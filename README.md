# Intensity Line Profile Extension for 3D Slicer

This project provides an extension for **3D Slicer** to calculate and visualize intensity line profiles along a specified path in medical images. The extension enables users to extract and analyze intensity variations along user-defined lines or curves within 3D volumes, facilitating detailed image analysis for tasks such as measuring tissue characteristics, tracking boundaries, or visualizing changes across regions of interest.

## Features:
- Compute intensity profiles along arbitrary lines or curves in 3D medical images.
- Display intensity values across the defined path in an interactive plot.
- Integrates seamlessly with the 3D Slicer environment for easy workflow integration.
- Supports 3D volumetric data and offers flexibility for medical image analysis.

## Installation:
1. Open **3D Slicer**.
2. Navigate to the **Extension Manager**.
3. Search for the **Intensity Line Profile** extension.
4. Select and install the extension through the **Extension Wizard**.

## Use Cases:
- **Radiology**: Analyzing intensity changes in CT or MRI scans for tissue characterization.
- **Pathology**: Measuring variations in tissue intensity for histological analysis.
- **Surgical Planning**: Assessing image features along specific trajectories.

## Contribution:
Feel free to contribute by submitting issues, pull requests, or feature requests to improve the extension. Your input is highly appreciated!
